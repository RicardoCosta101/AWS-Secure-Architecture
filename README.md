# AWS-Secure-Architecture
This is a school project that me and my collegues have worked for around 3 days

**This was a project to validate our school module and I found it very interresting as it made us discover what tools there are available on AWS and what are the best practices to make a Secure Infrastructure**

On this repository you will be able to find the config files we used to deploy this infrastructure on AWS as well as the document in French used to detail our choices and it also serves as I walkthrough on how to do what we did.

I'll try to have an Englis version of the document as soon as possible, I will also add the presentation we did with the notes as it was an important step on the project especially to specify the upgrades we could implement.

If you guys have any questions or tips, I'll gladly answer and note those tips for knownledge purposes.
